The 7.x-3.x branch of petitions aims to remove the application's dependency on
Mongo DB and run on MySQL. Between now and whenever 7.x-3.0 is released this
branch will be building out and refining a proof-of-concept for what will likely
turn out to be mysql-based petition nodes and signature entities.

For a stable Mongo-based petitions application, please use the 7.x-2.x branch.
