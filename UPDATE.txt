UPDATE
======

Version 7.x-1.0-alpha22 -> 7.x-1.0-alpha23
-----------------------------------------------

Release notes:

  - Rename petition install profile to petitions
  - Remove legacy petitions theme
  - Remove duplicate buttom from deleted petitions
  - Remove MongoDB patch that no longer needs to be maintained

Update steps:

  Before you update your code base:

  1. Log in and put your site into maintenace mode


  2. In a few minutes, the legacy "petitions" theme will be removed from the
     code base. Disable it before running the update (we assume you are using
     petitions44 or something other then petitions as your default theme.  If
     that is not true, you will need to enable another theme):

       drush dis petitions


  3. Disable contrib modules that may cause issues when the directory is
     reorganized.

       drush dis entity -y
       drush dis entitycache -y
       drush dis context -y
       drush dis feeds -y


  4. Clear ALL caches.

       drush eval "cache_clear_all('*', NULL, TRUE)"


  5. Change file paths in the database. Update.php and registry rebuild normally
     do this, but sometimes they need a little help.

       drush sqlq 'UPDATE system SET filename = replace (filename, "profiles/petition", "profiles/petitions");'
       drush sqlq 'UPDATE registry SET filename = replace (filename, "profiles/petition", "profiles/petitions");'
       drush sqlq 'UPDATE registry_file SET filename = replace (filename, "profiles/petition", "profiles/petitions");'


  6. Add this line to your settings.php

       $conf['install_profile'] = 'petitions';

     NOTE: If you have anything in your settings.php or anywhere else in you Petitions installation hardcoded to
     profiles/petition (for example the path to a memcache module include file), replace that with 'profile/petitions'
     too.


  Now you are ready to update:

  7. Deploy 7.x-1.0-alpha23 in your environment.


  8. Clear your cache, run update.php, and then run registry rebuild.

       drush cc all
       drush updb
       drush rr


  9. Re-enable modules previously disabled (and the dependencies disabled with them).

       drush en entity entity_token rules logintoboggan_rules profile2 petitions_user_registration rules_admin wh_user_profile wh_petitions wh_contexts wh_zipcodelookup wh_core wh_misc wh_petition_reporting wh_petition_tool wh_profile_migrate wh_response -y

       drush en entitycache context feeds feeds_ui taxonomy_sync -y


  10. Clear your cache, run update.php, and then run registry rebuild.

       drush cc all
       drush updb
       drush rr


  11. Put your site back online.
