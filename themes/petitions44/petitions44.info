; This section lists the regions defined in Zen's default page.tpl.php and
; maintenance-page.tpl.php files. The name in brackets is the machine name of
; the region. The text after the equals sign is a descriptive text used on the
; admin/structure/blocks page.
;
; In the page.tpl, the contents of the region are output with a
; $page['MACHINE-NAME'] variable and, in the maintenance-page.tpl, the region is
; output with a $MACHINE-NAME variable. For example, with this line in the .info
; file:
;   regions[header_top] = Header top
; You'll use this variable in page.tpl.php:
;   <?php print render($page['header_top']); ?>
; And you'll use this variable in maintenance-page.tpl.php:
;   <?php print $header_top; ?>

regions[takeover]       = Takeover

; The page_top and page_bottom regions are hidden, which means they will not
; show up on the blocks administration page. But they are required in order for
; the html.tpl.php to work properly, so do not delete them.
